Key Points
Notify Directive: The notify directive in a task specifies which handler to trigger if the task changes the state.
Handlers Execution: Handlers are executed at the end of the playbook run, after all tasks have been completed. If multiple tasks notify the same handler, the handler is executed only once.
Idempotence: Handlers help maintain idempotence by ensuring actions like service restarts are performed only when necessary.
Using handlers in Ansible playbooks helps manage changes efficiently and ensures that dependent actions (like restarting services) are executed only when required.
